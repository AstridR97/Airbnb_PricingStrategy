# Pricing Strategy Airbnb based on Negative Reviews

Is there a significant positive correlation between the price of Airbnb accommodations and the relative number of negative reviews they get? 

## Motivation

Deciding which price to charge for your product or service can be a challenging task. Yet, a good pricing strategy is a very important element marketers should consider. It depends on multiple major factors, e.g., the market, demands, and competitors. The best price is usually the highest price consumers are willing to pay. However, how do we find this ultimate WTP? 

It is no surprise Airbnb hosts all have different approaches when it comes to maximizing their earning potential. Penetration pricing strategy, however, is the most commonly used. The advantage of the platform for (potential) consumers is the ability to view accommodations reviews. In general, more positive reviews can help improve the hosting business. However, do these higher prices also lead to higher expectations in the consumers mind? And is charging a high price therefore more risky, in terms of negative reviews? Which potentially can lead to less bookings.

In this study, we investigate the relationship between price and negative reviews. In this way, we can study whether:
- charging a higher price is a risk in terms of setting the expectations too high, resulting in more negative reviews or;
- charging a higher price does not lead to more negative reviews, as expectations are likely to be met. 
Eventually, there is also a possibility that there is no significant correlation between these two variables. 

With the results of this analysis, Airbnb hosts can get more insights in whether the amount of negative reviews correlates with the price they charge. Leading to the possibility of choosing the best pricing strategy for their accommodation. 

(Motivate your research question or business problem. Clearly explain which problem is solved.)

## Method and results

The method used to indicate the amount of negative reviews per accommodation is via sentiment analysis. 

(First, introduce and motivate your chosen method, and explain how it contributes to solving the research question/business problem.

Second, summarize your results concisely. Make use of subheaders where appropriate.)
